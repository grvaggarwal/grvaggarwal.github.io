I work in the field of Model Risk Management with a leading Financial consultancy firm. My interests include Financial Risk Modeling and Analytics, Mathematical & Computational Finance, and Applications of Data Science to Finance. 

I hold a Masters in Mathematics from [IISER Mohali](www.iisermohali.ac.in).

### What lies ahead?

While you are here, feel free to read through the subsequent pages. I am interested in the problems of Mathematical Finance and these discussions are my attempts to learn. The page is open to criticism and contirbution.
