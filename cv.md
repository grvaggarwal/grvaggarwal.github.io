### Work Experience
**Deloitte & Touche AERS India Pvt. Ltd.** _CONSULTANT-II_

*2 years*

* Performed full-scale validation of credit risk models for the Retail portfolio for a leading US Bank. The models were assessed for
compliance with Basel 3, BCC13-5 and 14-3 guidelines. The data and modeling techniques were assessed for special treatment
of the low default portfolios.
* Performed full-scale validation of forecasting models for Pre-Provisions Net Revenue (PPNR) and Balance Sheet (BSM) Origination
Volumes for a leading US Bank. The scope of work included assessing the theoretical soundness, economic rationale, statistical
testing and related inferences across the models.
* Conducted assessment of the Bank’s Model Development and Validation Framework for alignment with best industry practices
and Supervisory Guidance on Model Risk Management (CCAR and SR 11/7).
* Conducted independent Annual Model Reviews for Credit Scorecard Models, assessing the model inputs and outputs, as an ongoing

_B.S.- M.S. (DUAL DEGREE) IN MATHEMATICS_

* The dissertation “Diffusion Processes: analysis and their applications” outlines the definition of stochastic differential equations
and Itô’s Lemma. It included an extensive study of the principles of probability theory with analysis of some historically relevant
examples of SDE’s.
* Attended the First Instructional School for Mathematical and Computational Biology organised by NNMCB. This included an elaborative
study of modules including Stochastic Processes, Time Series Analysis, ODE’s and PDE’s along with their applications in
Biological modeling.
* Recipient of Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research (INSPIRE) scholarship for higher education (SHE) provided by
DST, India.
